<!-- TITLE: is a convex sum of density matrices still a valid density matrix? -->

Many important states in quantum information are the sum of more than one density matrix.
One prominent example is the Werner state
$$
\rho_{W}=(1-\gamma)\frac{I}{4}+\gamma \mid\psi^{+}\rangle\langle\psi^{+}\mid,
$$
where \(I\) and \(\psi\) represent the identity matrix and a Bell state respectively.
In general such a convex sum of density matrices would look like
$$
\rho_{c}=\sum_{i}p_{i}\rho_{i},
$$
where the \(p_{i}\) all sum to unity.
Although the sum of two density matrices is obvious a valid density matrix in the example above, is this always true?
The answer is yes, and while texts on quantum information often mention that this is the case, I've never seen a very clear explanation of why this is.
For this reason I found it instructive to convince myself this is true, and below I summarize the results.
<br>
<br>
To prove that a convex sum of density matrices is still a density matrix we need to show that the <a href="./09202015.html">two conditions</a> on a valid density matrix:
$$
positive\;semidefinite \;\;\;\; \rho \ge 0,
$$
$$
normalized \;\;\;\; \text{Tr}(\rho) = 1,
$$
hold for the resulting density matrix.
<br>
<br>
Normalization is the simplest of these to show because the trace is a linear mapping, which means the following identity holds:
$$
\text{Tr}(aM+cN)=a\text{Tr}(M)+a\text{Tr}(N),
$$
where \(M\) and \(N\) are square matrices and \(a\) is a scalar.
Therefore, if we apply this directly to the definition of a convex sum above we find:
$$
\text{Tr}(\rho_{c})=\text{Tr}(\sum_{i}p_{i}\rho_{i})=\sum_{i}p_{i}\text{Tr}(\rho_{i})=\sum_{i}p_{i}=1,
$$
where the we use the fact that the coefficients of a convex sum add to one.
<!-- <br>
<br>
Likewise, the Hermiticity condition can be shown using an analogous identity for the conjugate transpose given by:
$$
(dA+eB)^{\dagger}=\bar{d}A^{\dagger}+\bar{e}B^{\dagger},
$$
where the \(d\) and \(e\) are complex numbers and \(A\) and \(B\) are two matrices of the same dimension.
The \(\dagger\) indicates the conjugate transpose and the overbar the complex conjugate.
Application of this to \(\rho_{c}\) results in:
$$
\rho_{c}^{\dagger}=(\sum_{i}p_{i}\rho_{i})^{\dagger}=\sum_{i}\bar{p}_{i}\rho_{i}^{\dagger}=\sum_{i}p_{i}\rho_{i}=\rho_{c}.
$$
The second to last equality is due to the convex coefficients being real and individual density matrices being Hermitian themselves. -->
<br>
<br>
The positivity condition is slightly more interesting.
To prove this condition we do not use the definition given <a href="./09202015.html">previously</a> (Hermitian with eigenvalues greater than or equal to zero) but instead define an \(n \times n\) positive semi-definite operator \(T\) as one where:
$$
x^{\dagger}Tx\ge0
$$
for all complex column vectors \(x\) of dimension \(n\).
Since matrix multiplication is distributive over addition we can simply plug \(\rho_{c}\) into the definition:
$$
x^{\dagger}\rho_{c}x=x^{\dagger}(\sum_{i}p_{i}\rho_{i})x=\sum_{i}p_{i}x^{\dagger}\rho_{i}x\ge0.
$$
We were able to pull the sum and \(p_{i}\) out because it is scalar multiplication.
The final step can be seen by considering that each density matrix itself is positive semidefinite and must be greater than or equal to zero, and since the \(p_{i}\) can't be negative the sum must be greater than or equal to zero.
